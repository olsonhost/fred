# phat aka Ph@
### (A portmanteau of Php and @)

# I'M GOING TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THIS TO "FRED"
### This tool is going to be platform agnostic so we won't be parting Php in it
#### Hence the name "Phat" or "Ph@", while terrible, don't relly apply to this things anymore

##### And since it has the syntax of ye old "Framework Fred" of Yore (see what I did there?) I think that "Fred" is a cool name for this.

###### Also my frog is named Fred

* And I have a brother named Fred
  * Somewhere
    * In Texas I think
      * He has a wife, you know

You can do other stuff too.  Like markdown and several "@" functions designed to work with Yore such as

@asset('dir/file.ext') - Returns a full path to an asset (usually an image) in the current site's theme

@body() - returns the page body as defined in the page JSON (you can use this instead of or in addition to HTML in your view file)

@data('var') - returns any top level element of the current page's JSON object. For examlle @data('body') would be the same as @body()

@edit('/dir/dir/file.txt') - returns the HTML for an edit button to allow the user to edit a server file (off of the web root) in the browser.  For example, @edit(#view) will return HTML for a button to edit the current view file source code

#view - returns the path and file name (relative to web root) of the current view
